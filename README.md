The goal of this notebook is to create machine learning models to predict stocks future share price. It emphasizes the use of time-series analysis on historical stock data to achieve this. The key objectives listed in this section are essential steps in developing a predictive model:

Data Acquisition and Preparation: Obtaining and cleaning the raw stock data to make it suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to understand its characteristics, distributions, and potential relationships.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to potentially improve the model's predictive power.

Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with different time-series models and training them on the prepared data.

Model Evaluation and Selection: Assessing the performance of the trained models and choosing the best one based on predefined metrics.

Visualization and Interpretation: Presenting the model's predictions and insights in a clear and understandable way.

The project's scope is limited to time-series data and quantitative analysis, excluding fundamental analysis and external factors.
